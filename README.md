Just a simple password generator with a built in password manager that encrypts the password. Generate a password, save it with an account name, and access saved passwords.

When saving a password you must enter a master password (DO NOT FORGET IT) and it will create "Pwrds.json" with the encrypted passwords. There can be multiple users who have diferent master passwords

NOTE: DO NOT DELETE "Pwrds.json" OTHERWISE ALL PASSWORDS WILL BE DELETED
